#### ‚úÖ **To compile and run:**

Make sure you have **SDL3 installed** and compile using:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game -std=c++17 `sdl3-config --cflags --libs`
./game
```

If `sdl3-config` doesn't exist, manually include the SDL3 paths:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game -std=c++17 -I/path/to/SDL3/include -L/path/to/SDL3/lib -lSDL3
./game
```
